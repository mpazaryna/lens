# Lens: Content-Aware Feed Aggregator

## 1. Overview

Lens is a next-generation feed aggregator that uses local AI models to intelligently filter, rank, and recommend content from RSS feeds based on user interests. The system distinguishes between different content types (particularly video vs. article content) and uses specialized processing paths for each, learning user preferences for topics and content formats over time.

## 2. Project Goals

- Create a personalized content discovery system that reduces information overload
- Leverage local AI models (via Ollama) to maintain privacy and control
- Support different content types with specialized processing paths
- Enable natural language queries for content discovery
- Learn from user behavior to improve recommendations over time
- Implement as a command-line tool with Deno runtime

## 5. Key Processes

### 5.1 Content Retrieval & Processing

1. **Scheduled Retrieval**:
   - System checks for feed updates based on update frequency
   - Fetches XML from RSS endpoints
   - Parses feed data and extracts new items

2. **Content Type Detection**:
   - Identifies content type based on source and content examination
   - Routes to appropriate processing path

3. **Video Processing**:
   - Extracts video metadata (duration, channel, etc.)
   - Attempts to retrieve transcript if available
   - Generates embeddings based on available text content
   - Calculates initial relevance score

4. **Article Processing**:
   - Extracts article text (full or summary)
   - Analyzes content structure and readability
   - Generates embeddings based on text content
   - Calculates initial relevance score

5. **Storage**:
   - Saves processed items to vector database
   - Updates indices for efficient retrieval

### 5.2 Content Recommendation

1. **Topic Extraction**:
   - Identifies main topics in content
   - Maps to user's known topic interests
   - Applies topic-based content type preferences

2. **Relevance Scoring**:
   - Combines multiple factors:
     - Topic alignment with user interests
     - Content quality indicators
     - Source authority/reliability
     - Recency and timeliness
     - Content type preference for topic
     - Similarity to previously engaged content

3. **Result Ranking**:
   - Orders content based on final relevance score
   - Groups or separates by content type based on user preference
   - Applies diversity mechanisms to avoid topic monotony

### 5.3 User Interaction

1. **Query Processing**:
   - Parses natural language queries
   - Identifies time constraints, topics, and content type preferences
   - Translates to vector database query

2. **Content Presentation**:
   - Displays ranked items with relevance explanation
   - Includes content-type specific metadata
   - Offers quick actions (read, save, skip)

3. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Tracks what user chooses to consume
   - Records completion status (partially read, fully watched)
   - Accepts explicit feedback when provided

4. **Preference Learning**:
   - Updates topic models based on engagement
   - Refines content type preferences for topics
   - Adjusts source weights based on user interaction

```
You are a specialized content analyzer. Evaluate this [content_type] based on the following information:

Title: {title}
Description: {description}
[Content-specific metadata]

1. Identify the main topics covered (comma-separated)
2. Assess if this aligns with the user's interest in: {user_interests}
3. Consider if the content format is appropriate for the topic
4. Rate relevance on a scale of 0-10
5. Provide a brief rationale (max 20 words)
```

#### Query Understanding Prompt
```
You are a content discovery assistant. Parse this user query:

"{user_query}"

Extract the following information:
1. Time frame (e.g., today, this week, recent)
2. Topics of interest
3. Content type preference (video, article, or both)
4. Any specific sources mentioned
5. Any qualifiers (short, detailed, beginner, advanced)
```

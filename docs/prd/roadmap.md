# Lens Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the high-level development plan for Lens, a content-aware feed aggregator that uses local AI models to intelligently filter, rank, and recommend content from RSS feeds based on user interests.

## Phase 1: Foundation

- Establish core infrastructure and architecture
- Implement feed fetching and basic parsing
- Set up database schema and storage
- Create content type detection system
- Build basic CLI interface
- Implement configuration management

## Phase 2: AI Integration

- Set up Ollama connection and integration
- Implement embedding generation for content
- Create basic relevance scoring algorithms
- Develop topic extraction capabilities
- Build initial recommendation system

## Phase 3: Content Type Specialization

- Implement video-specific processing path
- Implement article-specific processing path
- Create topic preference system
- Develop specialized presentation for different content types
- Enhance metadata extraction for various content formats

## Phase 4: Query Engine

- Implement natural language query parsing
- Create temporal filtering (this week, today, etc.)
- Develop combined ranking algorithm
- Build feedback collection system
- Enhance search capabilities with semantic understanding

## Phase 5: Learning & Optimization

- Implement preference learning from user behavior
- Create user interaction tracking
- Develop automated topic mapping
- Build system performance analytics
- Optimize resource usage for local deployment

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

- Implement content summarization
- Add cross-referencing between content items
- Create content clustering for topic exploration
- Develop export/import of user preferences
- Build enhanced transcript retrieval for videos

## Phase 7: Expansion

- Develop web interface for easier visualization
- Add social sharing and recommendation features
- Implement multi-user support with shared collections
- Create API for third-party integrations
- Build mobile companion applications

## Guiding Principles

Throughout all phases, development will adhere to these principles:

- **Privacy-First**: Keep user data and processing local
- **Content-Type Awareness**: Specialized handling for different content formats
- **User Adaptability**: Learn from user behavior to improve over time
- **Functional Programming**: Maintain clean, testable, and maintainable code
- **Modular Design**: Build components with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies

This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, technological advancements, and project priorities.

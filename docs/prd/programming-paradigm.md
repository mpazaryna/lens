# Programming Paradigm

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the programming paradigm chosen for the Lens project. It establishes functional programming as the primary approach for all code development and provides a rationale for this architectural decision.

## 2. Functional Programming Approach

The Lens project adopts functional programming (FP) as its primary programming paradigm, rather than object-oriented programming (OOP). This decision affects all aspects of the codebase and establishes a consistent approach for all contributors.

### 2.1 Core Principles

All code in the Lens project should adhere to these functional programming principles:

1. **Pure Functions**: Functions should be pure whenever possible, with no side effects and consistent outputs for the same inputs.

2. **Immutability**: Data should be treated as immutable. Instead of modifying existing data structures, create new ones with the desired changes.

3. **Function Composition**: Complex operations should be built by composing smaller, focused functions.

4. **Minimal State**: State should be minimized and state changes should be explicit and contained.

5. **Type-Driven Development**: TypeScript's type system should be used to guide implementation and make illegal states unrepresentable.

### 2.2 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

The following patterns should be avoided in the Lens codebase:

1. **Classes with Internal State**: Avoid creating classes that maintain internal state.

2. **Inheritance Hierarchies**: Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies; prefer composition.

3. **Methods that Modify Object State**: Avoid methods that modify the state of objects.

4. **Complex Object Graphs**: Avoid creating complex networks of interconnected objects.

## 3. Rationale

### 3.1 Why Functional Programming for Lens?

The decision to use functional programming for Lens is based on several factors:

1. **Data Pipeline Nature**: Lens is primarily a data processing application that fetches, transforms, and filters content. This aligns perfectly with functional programming's strength in data transformation pipelines.

2. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Functional code tends to be more declarative, focusing on "what" rather than "how," making it easier to understand at a glance.

3. **Testability**: Pure functions with no side effects are inherently easier to test since they always produce the same output for the same input.

4. **Reduced State Management Complexity**: Managing state is often simpler with functional approaches, especially for an application that processes data pipelines.

5. **Concurrency Safety**: As Lens may evolve to handle multiple feeds simultaneously, functional code with immutable data structures is safer in concurrent environments.

### 3.2 Benefits for an Open Source Project

The functional approach provides specific benefits for Lens as an open source project:

1. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Many JavaScript developers are already familiar with functional patterns, making it easier for new contributors to join.

2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: With fewer moving parts and side effects, contributors can more easily understand isolated parts of the codebase.

3. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Functional composition creates more flexible code structures than inheritance hierarchies, making the code more adaptable to changing requirements.

4. **Smaller Surface Area**: Functional interfaces often have a smaller surface area than object-oriented ones, making them easier to document and understand.

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Managing Side Effects

Pure functions are ideal, but real applications need side effects (file I/O, network requests, etc.). These effects should be contained at the edges of the application:

1. **Core Logic**: Keep business logic pure and free of side effects.
2. **Edge Functions**: Isolate side effects in specific edge functions.
3. **Clear Separation**: Maintain a clear separation between pure and impure code.

### 4.2 State Management

For application state, consider using a reducer pattern:

1. **Immutable State**: Treat application state as immutable.
2. **Action-Based Updates**: Use actions to describe state changes.
3. **Pure Reducers**: Implement state transitions as pure functions.

### 4.3 Error Handling

Prefer functional error handling approaches:

1. **Return Types**: Use return types like `Result<T, E>` or `Either<E, T>` to represent operations that might fail.
2. **No Exceptions**: Avoid throwing exceptions for control flow.
3. **Explicit Error Paths**: Make error paths explicit in the type system.

## 5. Relationship to Other Architectural Decisions

The functional programming approach complements other architectural decisions in the Lens project:

1. **Component-Based Design**: Functional components with clear interfaces align well with our component-based architecture.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Functional programming encourages clear separation of concerns through function composition.
3. **Extensibility**: Functional code is often more extensible through higher-order functions and composition.

# CLI Command Design

> **Note:** This document represents a future direction that the application may evolve towards as it grows. It is not a formal design specification but rather a collection of ideas and possibilities. The actual implementation may differ significantly as requirements are refined.

## Command Reference

### Configuration Commands
```
add <url> [--type=video|article|mixed]    # Add new feed source
remove <source-id>                        # Remove feed source
configure topics                           # Manage topic preferences
```

### Content Retrieval Commands
```
fetch                                      # Update all feeds
fetch <source-id>                          # Update specific feed
```

### Content Discovery Commands
```
list [--limit=10]                          # Show top recommended content
videos [--topic=<topic>]                   # List video content only
articles [--topic=<topic>]                 # List article content only
topic <topic>                              # List content for specific topic
recent [--days=7]                          # Show recent content
```

### Content Interaction Commands
```
read <id>                                  # View content details
open <id>                                  # Open in browser
feedback <id> [--score=1|-1]               # Provide explicit feedback
```

### Natural Language Interface
```
query "what tech videos came in this week" # Natural language query
```

## Future Considerations

This CLI design represents exploratory thinking about how the application might evolve. As development progresses, we'll refine these ideas based on:

- User feedback and usage patterns
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Integration with other system components
- Prioritization of features based on value

The final implementation may incorporate some, all, or none of these commands, potentially with significant modifications to better serve user needs.

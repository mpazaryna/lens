# Promoting Code from Lab to Production

## Overview

This devlog discusses the process of promoting code from lab implementations to production-ready modules. It uses our recent work on the template system as a case study to illustrate when and how to promote lab code.

## The Lab-to-Production Spectrum

Lab implementations exist on a spectrum of readiness for production:

1. **Early Prototype**: Quick, messy implementations focused on proving a concept
2. **Refined Prototype**: More structured code with basic tests and documentation
3. **Production-Ready Lab**: Well-structured, well-tested, well-documented code that happens to live in a lab directory
4. **Production Module**: Code that follows all project conventions and is officially part of the production codebase

The key insight is that **the transition from lab to production can be gradual**. Not all lab code needs to be completely rewritten before being used in production.

## Case Study: Template System

Our template system implementation has evolved from a basic prototype to what is essentially production-ready code that happens to live in the lab directory.

### Current State

The template system currently:

- Uses a functional programming approach with composition
- Has comprehensive JSDocs throughout
- Includes thorough tests
- Separates concerns between the template engine and client
- Organizes templates in a logical structure outside the source code

The only major difference between our current implementation and a "production" implementation is the file organization:

```
Current (Lab):
/src/templates/lab/
├── template_engine.ts       # All engine functionality in one file
├── template_client.ts       # All client functionality in one file
└── test/
    ├── template_engine_test.ts
    └── template_client_test.ts

Potential Production:
/src/templates/
├── mod.ts                   # Main entry point that exports everything
├── types.ts                 # Type definitions and interfaces
├── engine.ts                # Template engine functionality
├── client.ts                # Template client functionality
└── test/
    ├── engine_test.ts
    ├── client_test.ts
    └── utils_test.ts
```

### Promotion Options

When lab code reaches this level of maturity, we have several options:

1. **Use As-Is**: Simply start using the lab implementation directly
   - Pros: No additional work required
   - Cons: May not follow project conventions perfectly

2. **Light Refactoring**: Keep in the lab but improve organization
   - Pros: Better organization without full promotion overhead
   - Cons: Still technically "lab" code

3. **Full Promotion**: Move to production with proper file structure
   - Pros: Follows all project conventions
   - Cons: Requires more work for primarily organizational benefits

### When to Promote

Consider promoting lab code when:

1. **It's stable**: The API is unlikely to change significantly
2. **It's well-tested**: Comprehensive tests cover the functionality
3. **It's well-documented**: Clear documentation explains usage
4. **It's needed elsewhere**: Multiple parts of the codebase need this functionality
5. **It's mature**: The implementation has been refined through iterations

### How to Promote

The promotion process typically involves:

1. **Extract types**: Move interfaces and types to a dedicated file
2. **Split functionality**: Break large files into smaller, focused modules
3. **Create entry point**: Add a mod.ts file that exports the public API
4. **Update tests**: Ensure tests cover the refactored code
5. **Update documentation**: Ensure documentation reflects the new structure
6. **Update imports**: Update any existing imports to use the new structure

## Lessons Learned

1. **Lab code can be production-quality**: The location of code doesn't determine its quality
2. **Gradual evolution is valid**: Not all lab code needs a complete rewrite
3. **Focus on value**: Prioritize changes that add real value, not just organizational purity
4. **Documentation matters**: Well-documented lab code is easier to promote
5. **Tests enable confidence**: Comprehensive tests make promotion safer

## Conclusion

Our template system has reached a point where it's functionally production-ready, even though it lives in the lab directory. The decision to promote it should be based on project needs and priorities, not on an arbitrary rule that all lab code must be rewritten.

The most important factor is not where the code lives, but whether it's well-structured, well-tested, and well-documented. Our template system meets these criteria, making it a good candidate for promotion when needed.

Remember that the purpose of labs is to explore and refine approaches. When a lab implementation evolves to the point where it's nearly production-ready, that's a sign of successful lab work, not a failure to follow process.

## Next Steps

For the template system specifically, we recommend:

1. Continue using it in its current form for immediate needs
2. Consider light refactoring to split into smaller files if more features are added
3. Fully promote to a production module when it becomes a core part of the application

This approach balances pragmatism with good software engineering practices, allowing us to get value from our lab work without unnecessary overhead.

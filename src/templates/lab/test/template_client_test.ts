/**
 * Tests for the Template Client
 *
 * This module contains tests for the template client functionality.
 * It tests the following features:
 * 1. Extracting topics from content
 * 2. Reformulating queries
 *
 * These tests ensure that the template client works correctly and
 * can be used to perform common tasks with templates and LLMs.
 *
 * Note: These tests require Ollama to be running locally for full testing,
 * but they are designed to work even if Ollama is not running.

 * If the response is successful and can be parsed as JSON, it checks that
 * the topics have the expected structure with "topic" and "relevance" properties.

      TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript,
      giving you better tooling at any scale. It adds additional syntax to JavaScript
      to support a tighter integration with your editor. This can help catch errors early in your editor.

      TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs:
      In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

      TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling
      without additional code.
